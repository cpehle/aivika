Aivika -- a multi-paradigm simulation library

Aivika is a small simulation library that covers many paradigms. 
It allows integrating a system of ordinary differential equations. 
Also it can be applied to the Discrete Event Simulation. It supports 
the event-oriented, process-oriented and activity-oriented paradigms. 
Aivika also supports the Agent-based Modeling. Finally, it can be applied 
to System Dynamics. 

It is possible due to using a very general approach when the basic 
modeling entity is just a function of simulation time. The paradigms
are mainly distinguished by sets of the functions that are used to 
model the activities. These sets are small and do not pretend
to be comprehensive. Aivika is mostly a proof-of-concept project
rather than a big library that knows everything.

The library widely uses monads. The dynamic system is represented as 
a computation in the Dynamics monad. There is also the Process
monad to represent the discontinuous processes which can suspend
at any time and then resume later. There is also the Simulation monad
that represents a simulation run, in which scope the previous 
two monads exist. Almost everything is expressed through these monads, 
including the event handlers, agent handlers and even integrals 
except for the parameters and statistics that already use the IO monad.

Please note that the documentation is outdated and it corresponds to 
version 0.2 but it can still be helpful.

Also please look at another my package on GitHub
<https://github.com/dsorokin/aivika-experiment>
that complements the Aivika library and allows specifying the simulation 
experiments that are easy to define and easy to analyze. The simulation 
experiments are extensible and you can add your own views in which the 
results can be saved. For example, the results might be saved as 
the PDF documents or charts in the PNG format.
