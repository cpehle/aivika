-- It corresponds to model MachRep2 described in document 
-- Introduction to Discrete-Event Simulation and the SimPy Language
-- [http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/156/PLN/DESimIntro.pdf]. 
-- SimPy is available on [http://simpy.sourceforge.net/].
--   
-- The model description is as follows.
--   
-- Two machines, but sometimes break down. Up time is exponentially 
-- distributed with mean 1.0, and repair time is exponentially distributed 
-- with mean 0.5. In this example, there is only one repairperson, so 
-- the two machines cannot be repaired simultaneously if they are down 
-- at the same time.
--
-- In addition to finding the long-run proportion of up time as in
-- model MachRep1, letâ€™s also find the long-run proportion of the time 
-- that a given machine does not have immediate access to the repairperson 
-- when the machine breaks down. Output values should be about 0.6 and 0.67.
