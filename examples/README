More examples are bundled with packages aivika-experiment and aivika-experiment-chart. 
They plot charts, save the simulation results in the CSV files and generate 
HTML web pages which can be observed in your favourite Internet browser.

Some examples define a parametric Monte-Carlo simulation, after which the deviation 
charts and histograms are plotted, for example.

The reason why these packages are separated is that they have more heavy dependencies
while the engine itself is very light-weight and compact. But the additional packages 
should work on Linux, Windows and OS X. I tested on all three platforms.

Also you may find more examples on GitHub by the following link:

I'm going to add new models to that Git repository. At least, one of them will use
arrays or vectors.
