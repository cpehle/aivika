More examples are bundled with packages aivika-experiment and aivika-experiment-chart. 
They plot charts and save the simulation results in the files that can be loaded then 
in R or Microsoft Excel or OpenOffice.org. Some examples define a parametric Monte-Carlo 
simulation, after which the deviation charts and histograms are plotted, for example.

The reason why these packages are separated is that they have more heavy dependencies
while the engine itself is very light-weight and compact. But the additional packages 
should work on Linux, Windows and OS X. I tested on all three platforms.
